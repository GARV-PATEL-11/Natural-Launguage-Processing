    "\n",
    ">  **1960 to 1985:**\n",
    "  During this period, **rationalist thinking dominated** key fields like **linguistics**, **psychology**, **artificial intelligence**, and **natural language processing (NLP)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Pre-1960s:**\n",
    "  Before the rise of rationalism, **empiricism** was more prevalent (roughly 1920–1960), particularly in psychology and learning theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Rationalist Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Core Belief:**  A **significant part of human knowledge is innate** – it is not acquired from sensory experience but is **hardwired into the brain**, likely through **genetic inheritance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Proponent:**\n",
    "  **Noam Chomsky**, who introduced the idea of an **innate language faculty**, especially through the theory of **Universal Grammar**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logical Justification – Poverty of the Stimulus:**\n",
    "  Chomsky argued that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Children learn complex language structures despite having **limited, inconsistent, and noisy linguistic input** during early childhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To solve this paradox, the rationalist view claims that **some core structures of language must already be present in the mind at birth**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In Artificial Intelligence:**\n",
    "  Rationalists believed that to mimic human intelligence, we must **hand-code a lot of knowledge and rules** into machines, reflecting what the human brain “starts with.”\n",

    "  * Pattern recognition\n",
    "  * Generalization\n",

    "#### **Contextual Limitations in NLP**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers **cannot always observe language in real-world contexts**. Instead, they rely on written texts, treating the **textual context as a substitute** for real-life language usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **collection of such texts is called a *corpus*** (from the Latin word meaning “body”).\n",
    "* When multiple such bodies exist, they are referred to as **corpora**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Corpus-based methods reflect the **empiricist tradition** in linguistics. This tradition was notably supported by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **J. R. Firth**, who famously said:\n",
    "\n",
    "  > \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\"\n",
    "  > *(Firth, 1957)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **American structuralists**, especially **Zellig Harris**, promoted a similar idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * His work (e.g., *Harris, 1951*) aimed to **automatically discover linguistic structure** through procedures applied to text.\n",
    "  * Although his work was not computationally oriented, it emphasized creating **compact, descriptive models** of corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Rationalist vs. Empiricist Approaches**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rationalist (e.g., Chomskyan) linguistics** seeks to understand the **internal mental representation of language (I-language)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Texts (E-language) are seen as indirect evidence, **supplemented by native speaker intuitions**.\n",
    "  * Emphasis is placed on **linguistic competence**—the idealized mental knowledge of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Empiricist approaches**, in contrast, focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Actual language usage (**E-language**),\n",
    "  * Observable patterns in real-world texts,\n",
    "  * And **linguistic performance**, which includes imperfect real-world behavior (e.g., errors, distractions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Chomsky (1965) highlighted the distinction:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linguistic competence** = knowledge in the speaker's mind.\n",
    "* **Linguistic performance** = actual usage, affected by real-world conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "* These systems often tackled **toy problems**.\n",
    "* They lacked **objective evaluations** of their methods.\n",

    "In contrast, **modern NLP emphasizes engineering**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalable, real-world solutions** using raw text,\n",
    "* **Quantitative evaluation and comparison** of techniques,\n",
    "* **Practical applicability** over theoretical purity.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Statistical NLP Prevails**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical NLP methods have become dominant because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform **automatic knowledge induction** (learning from data),\n",
    "* Handle **ambiguity** better,\n",
    "* Support **real-world tasks** and evaluations,\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Chomskyan linguistics** and **early American structuralism** rely on **categorical principles**:\n",

    "  * A sentence is either **grammatical** or **not**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Statistical NLP**, influenced by **Claude Shannon**, applies **probability theory**:\n",

    "  * Sentences are evaluated based on how **likely or frequent** they are.\n",
    "  * Focus is on **common patterns** and **probabilistic associations**, not rare, abstract constructions.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insight**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical NLP often achieves **high real-world performance** by focusing on **frequent sentence patterns** and the **probabilities of linguistic events**, rather than seeking perfection in rare, theoretical cases.\n",
